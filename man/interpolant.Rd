\title{Evaluate an interpolant in a point}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The argument of the function. A function of more then one variable takes a
vector. \code{x} can also be a matrix of column vectors.}

\item{threads}{The number of threads to use for evaluation. All  interpolants created by
\code{ipol} are parallelized. If given a matrix argument \code{x}, the vectors can
be evaluated in parallel.}

\item{...}{Other parameters. Currently used for simplex linear interpolants with the logical argument
The \code{"multilinear"} interpolant also has the argument \code{blend=c("linear","cubic","sigmoid")} where a
blending function can be chosen.}
}
\value{
A numeric. If more than one point was evaluated, a vector.
}
\description{
An interpolant is a function returned by \code{\link{ipol}} which has prespecified values in some
points, and which fills in between with some reasonable values.
