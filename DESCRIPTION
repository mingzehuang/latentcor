Description: The first stand-alone R package for computation of latent correlation that takes into account all variable types (continuous/binary/ordinal/zero-inflated),
             comes with an optimized memory footprint, and is computationally efficient, essentially making latent correlation estimation almost as fast as rank-based correlation estimation.
             The estimation is based on latent copula Gaussian models.
             For continuous/binary types, see Fan, J., Liu, H., Ning, Y., and Zou, H. (2017) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12168>.
             For ternary type, see Quan X., Booth J.G. and Wells M.T. (2018) <arXiv:1809.06255>.
             For truncated type or zero-inflated type, see Yoon G., Carroll R.J. and Gaynanova I. (2020) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asaa007>.
             For approximation method of computation, see Yoon G., MÃ¼ller C.L. and Gaynanova I. (2021) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2021.1882468>. The latter method uses multi-linear interpolation originally implemented in the R package `chebpol` <https://cran.r-project.org/package=chebpol>.
